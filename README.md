# Tank-game
Tank flash game

*UNDER DEVELOPMENT*

Flash game
Requires Adobe Flash Player to run and Adobe Flash to edit/create
Made with Adobe Creative Suite 4 using Actionscript 3.0

After years of planning, you have managed to break into a military compound and steal what else, but a tank.
Drive forward and back with the up and down arrow keys.
Turn left and right with the left and right arrow keys.
Fire the big cannon with a click on the left side of the mouse.


Ideas for further development:
-change keys to WASD
-make smaller cannon operable
-update graphics
-add buildings and scenery that react to being hit by tank shells and tank itself. (houses, cars, fences, trees, rocks)
